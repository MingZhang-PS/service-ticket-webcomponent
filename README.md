# service-ticket-webcomponent

The service ticket form is built on [W3C web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). And all controls in the form are import from [ui5-webcomponents](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/).
We hope the service ticket form as a standard web components can be reused by all UI framework.
